Question - Einstein's Riddle: Here's the riddle in three pieces:

Background:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors
A person with a different nationality lives in each house
The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet
No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage

Clues:
The Brit lives in the red house
The Swede keeps dogs as pets
The Dane drinks tea
The green house is on the left of the white house
The green homeowner drinks coffee
The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds
The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill
The man living in the center house drinks milk
The Norwegian lives in the first house
The man who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps cats
The man who keeps the horse lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill
The owner who smokes Blue Master drinks beer
The German smokes prince
The Norwegian lives next to the blue house
The man who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks water

The Question:
Who has fish for a pet? (I would then give them the Background, Clues, and Question in writing and offer them a white board market and ask them to show me their work.)
